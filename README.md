## Usage

```
This is an ecommerce application that enables users to shop for items online at the site. When users open the site, they are presented with the home page and are able to see all the available items on offer. Users can then directly add any item of their choice to their cart via a button on each item or go to the product detils page where they are presented with detailed information about the product including its description and rating. In that page, they can also add the product to thier cart if they wish. After they are through with browsing products and selecting products that they want, they can they take a look at their cart by pressing the cart icon. This  takes them to the cart page, where they can see all the items they have selected and the total cost. They can then delete an item or checkout. On pressing the checkout button they are presented with a popup element which shows them their order details including total price. They are then prompted to confirm their purchase. If they confirm their purchase,  the cart is cleared and they are redirected back to the homepage.
